Title: Everything You Need to Dress Better on a Budget

Transcription:
 You don't need to spend a ton of money to dress better. It's only about what you get, where you get it, and how you wear it. So, let's start off with the first one. When you're starting off to buy nicer clothes and you want to start dressing better, you should only focus on versatile and essential items. And I know I've said this so many times, but believe me, you still need to hear it. So, hypothetically, if I were to restart my wardrobe, this is what I would get first. Plain T-shirts, shorts leave, and long sleeve, quarter zips, well-fitting jeans, well-fitting pants, the hoodie, sweater, few jackets, and a polo. To me, this is a perfect base. With these clothes, you can go to pretty much any occasion, and still look pretty good. However, when you're buying these clothes, there's a few things to keep in mind. For one, the color. So, all these pieces look good with pretty much anything, but it won't look good if you get a bunch of different colors. I personally like to stick to neutral colors, just because they're so easy to wear in between. So, for example, if I got a black t-shirt, a grey hoodie, black pants, and beige jeans, I can mix all of these, and it's still going to look good. It doesn't matter the color. Now, that being said, when you hear this, sure, technically, if you get everything in the color black, you could pair all of it. But, that's very real. That is very boring. In fact, that's probably one of the first mistakes that I made when I started getting into men's fashion was thinking, I look good in the color black, so everything that I need to buy here on out should be in the color black. At that point, it's really not dressing better. You're just being safe. Another thing to keep in mind when you're buying these clothes is the fit. I like most things in slim fit. The most of my pants are slim fit. My t-shirts, definitely, polos, absolutely. Both of these things aren't slim fit. And I gotta say, slim fit is probably the most versatile, but again, if you're just starting off, get most things in slim fit, but you could definitely experiment with like an oversized hoodie, oversized t-shirt. But again, I really gotta stress the importance of getting your base first, and then you can start experimenting with other things. Assuming that you have them when you introduce yourself. And once you get your base, that's when you're able to start exploring with different things. All what I like to do is get more of the things that I know I'm gonna wear. For example, I love hoodies. There's some of the different ways to wear it, and I know if I buy different hoodies, that's definitely something that I'm always gonna be wearing. So getting it in different fits, different colors, different brands. To me, that's a smart way to start shopping for a wardrobe that I could wear anytime and anywhere. Or you could also start experimenting with different kinds of fabrics. Fabrics and textures is probably one of the easiest ways to dress better. And you're not really switching up too much. So for example, instead of just a crew neck sweatshirt, you can start getting sweaters in a cable knit, in a knit design, in different fabrics like cashmere, wool, anything like that. And I know those sound very expensive, but that's exactly what we're talking about. The next thing is where to get your clothes. So of course, this just depends on your budget. If you're very limited and you don't have a ton, the first place you should look at is secondhand clothing. You can go to three stores like Goodwill, Salvation Army, or whatever's close to you. You could also find some gems on places like E-Day, Washmark, or Deepop. This is a great way to start buying clothes if you don't have a lot of money. This is exactly what I used to do when I was a teenager. I used to find some absolute gems. Another place that I used to love to shop at was places like Ross and Marshalls. Now these are US companies, but basically the whole idea with these is you can get marked down items from other brands like Calvin Klein, Levi's. Sometimes even places like Ralph Lauren. These are mostly just things that didn't sell in their normal stores, and then Ross and Marshalls would buy it for cheaper, and therefore selling it to you for even cheaper. Now it's definitely been a while since I've went to one of these stores, but I can guarantee you if you go at least three times, you are going to find something good. I used to get a lot of flannels, jackets, but again, not very expensive. And the step above that is going to be fast fashion stores like H&M, ASOS, or ZARA. Again, if you're on a budget, the first place you need to check out is Clarence Actions Sales, or just anything that's marked down from the actual brand. This is actually something that I still do to this day. I try not to buy clothes for full price. I only ever do if we're entering a new season, and I know these items probably are not going to go and sell, but there are some brands that do sell things at a discount coming into a new season. So here's exactly all the brands that I would shop that on a budget. One of the best places to check out is Hollister. This one is definitely very underrated. I think that's because when most people think of Hollister, they think of every single piece of clothing having that bird on it. I definitely would say away from these things, but there are so many pieces of a mallister that doesn't have that, and they look identical to Avrocrombie pieces, because they're owned by the same company. And just to prove it to you, here are my best items from Hollister. And it's one of my more comfortable items, so I wear the St. Tone. Now I gotta say, this one probably isn't available in store anymore, but I'm gonna be linking some alternatives if I could find any. One of my more recent pickups is this linen jacket. And I think I picked this up for only $50, and for one, it's linen. I absolutely love linen. The fit is incredible. I love the color, and especially for the price, it's hard to find anything even similar. I'm also a really big fan of hoodies from Hollister. They're always incredibly soft. They have a good fit, so for me, it's one of those items that I can't go wrong with. But there's one item in particular that I think Hollister should be known for. And that is their pants. And that's because they always have sales going on, where you can buy their pants for $25, $30, or $35. These are things like chinos, jeans, and different fits, bunch of different colors. And I gotta say, they hold up pretty nicely. So especially for pants, I think Hollister is one of the best places to check out. So if you're sleeping on Hollister, give it a try, and I guarantee you, you'll love it. Now this next brand is an absolute no-brainer, and that is unique look. This is pretty much the Internet's favorite brand right now, and I think it's for good reason. It's affordable, and it's great quality. And again, to prove it, here are my best items. I picked up some wool sweaters. More specifically, these are a lamb wool. They have an amazing fit. In 80% of other brands, wool is gonna be well over $150, but I picked these up for less than $100 each. And something very similar is Casimir. Most brands are gonna sell Casimir for $200, but again, this one is only $100. If you've never felt Casimir before, this is the perfect place to get it. It's extremely soft, perfect for the fall, and I absolutely love the fit. But I did pick up a green one from Uniquello. This one was only $40. I love the color. It's insanely soft. I'm gonna be wearing this eight ton. And of course, I gotta mention at least one pair of pants. I love Corde Roy, especially Corde Roy pants, and these from Uniquello just look incredible. And they actually have a bunch of different colors. I also own it in a green. These are definitely more of a trouser. It's has a little bit more sophisticated, and it looks great. Now I mentioned hoodies. My absolute favorite place to get affordable hoodies is ours. This is only $65, and let me tell you, I own eight hundred hoodies. Hours is probably my favorite one. It's because the price is amazing, and I love the colors that ours drops. All right, stepping into them a little bit more of an expensive brand, but anything that this brand drops, I absolutely love. And that is Avrocrombie. Now it's still definitely affordable, because you could still find a ton of different items for less than a hundred bucks. And here's everything that I would buy. So for one, you're jeans. I think these reads out for about 80 bucks, which is definitely a little bit more on the steep side, but these jeans last me forever. They're insanely good quality, and they're perfect for the fall and winter, because they're thick enough to keep you warm. And again, they just have so many different fits and colors, like there's pretty much something for everybody. And I absolutely love their polos. In fact, I'm so excited to go to Avrocrombie this fall, so I can pick up more sweater polos, because honestly, that's kind of a blew up Avrocrombie more recently. Their sweater polos are amazing, and I'm definitely going to be wearing a ton of them. They also have really good sweaters, which is an absolute fall essential. So not only am I going to be leaving a link to everything that I'm talking about, but also everything that I'm going to shop for this new season that is still affordable. Now, around that same price range is Banana Republic. This brand is one of the best brands to shop for high quality material, but not so expensive. So when I think of Banana Republic, I think of Casimir, I think of Wool, but for significantly less than what other brands would charge for. So here are my favorite items. Again, a Casimir sweater for around 150 bucks. This one I've had for well over a year now, and I still love it. It's held up nicely, it's still incredibly soft, and I love the slump fit. I also got a wool blend coat that just looks amazing. In fact, when I put this on, I feel like Bruce Wayne. So if you've never experimented with the coat before, definitely get one similar to this, especially for Banana Republic, if you don't want to spend a ton of money. I also love their polos. You can get so many different types of polos, sweater polos, and a bunch of different materials, or costing less than $60. And finally, probably one of the most important things are shoes. Now, I've always said it, but most shoes under 100 bucks are just really boring, and you're going to see this everywhere. But here are some of my favorite options for around that price range. So keeping things under 100 bucks, let's talk about the Puma slipstreams. This is a little bit more on the underrated side, but they're comfortable, they look good, and they're very versatile. Now, the most classic one is going to be Converse. You just can't go wrong with Converse. I personally would go with Converse Chuck 70s. Here's one called the Converse Chuck 70 Marquis. This one looks amazing. I'm going to be wearing this a ton in the fall. Now, if you have 150 bucks, you can get a little bit more better options. I personally would go with Doc Martin's. Now, again, this is a classic. You're going to see this a lot, but it's one of the best shoes, or if you want to get the boots. When it comes to pricing quality, I love Doc Martin's. And finally, probably one of the most important things is how you wear it. It doesn't really matter how many items you own. It's all about what you wear and how you wear it. And the best way to start getting into this is just getting out of your inspiration. Start finding influencers who you like how they dress. And for right now, just start copying it down to a tee. Now, once you get comfortable with that, then you can start experimenting with your own things, your own styles. And you're just going to start noticing preferences that you have to make things your own. It's the same thing with aesthetics. So if you like the old-money style, if you like streetwear, quite literally whatever you want. It's always great to experiment with things, and again, just see what you like. But at the very least, you should be matching colors. And there's so many ways to do this. But I personally would just go and Pinterest, search up, brown, out of fit, men. And then that's a good way to start. And the easiest way to dress better is just by layering. You're on a jacket, throw more layers. Of course, if the weather allows you, and that's a great way to dress better. Now, I didn't talk about how much I love the Negro, and if you want to see the 10th best items for a Negro, here's a video that's going to show you exactly that.

Title: Is Uniqlo Really THAT Good?

Transcription:
 This is the richest man in Japan and the 31st richest man on the entire planet. He's worth 42.8 billion dollars. And today he made what is 100 billion 800 million times 30 times like I'm making these numbers up. Today he made 1.5 billion dollars. Now interestingly this is what it looks like to look through a 40 dollar lightweight sweater for Mr. Yonai's company. And this is what it looks like to look through a 10 times more expensive sweater that is also lightweight. The difference is very obvious if I show it to you right away. But if I don't show it to you and one of these shirts is worth 40 dollars and the other is worth 350 dollars, which one is worth which? I tricked you. I paid 40 dollars for both of them. They are the exact same quality. Mr. Yonai is the founder of what many believe to be the greatest clothing brand on planet Earth. The perfect balance between quality and affordability. His leadership style is said to be that of a dictator's and when he first inherited his father's clothing business, every single employee in the company except one walked out. Congrats to that guy by the way. He probably also made a billion dollars today. Mr. Yonai wants complete control over every facet of his business. How things are folded, how the credit card is handed back to the customer, what people say to customers, but apparently it works because his brand has one of the strongest coat following that I've ever seen in my entire life. So naturally I wanted to get into the ring and see what the heck is going on with this brand and how it actually works. And if it even makes quality stuff or if it doesn't. Also I totally forgot to say that I was kidding. One of these shirts is $40. The other is $350. They are very different. Japan is now kind of the leading word for quality. If you get a Japanese sweater, Japanese jeans, T-shirt, yarns from Japan, whatever it may be, it's considered to be the best of the best of the best. But what happens if a Japanese company instead of doing everything in house in Japan says let's take that same level of quality and obsession for detail and do everything overseas. So we can make things much cheaper. What do you get? Also I just want to nip this in the bud. Not sponsored by Uniclo. Never spoke with Uniclo before in my life. This is certainly not a Uniclo fluff piece as we'll be shown later. I just, this is fascinating. Oh, it's just nature. You can lick that. This video will be split into four parts. The good is Uniclo just cheap fast fashion and marketing, the bad, and the ugly. We'll also be comparing similarly styled garments from radically different price points for better understanding. Thank you for your viewership. Subnirds, it's Michael. It's really terrific to see you, especially back out. In the great wilderness, I'm covered in so much bug spray that my skin squeaks when I've moved my arms, which is kind of weird. But we're starting off with cotton, the good. Also look at the size of this deer I saw while walking through the woods. On one end, we have Uniclo with their Uniclo U T-shirt that goes for $20 and their sweater that goes for $40. On the other end, we have the standard and strange Waka Yama T-shirt that goes for $95, which by the way, thank you to standard and strange. They basically let me walk into their store and rob them blind. I had guns, so that made it easier. They just said whatever you want for a video, whatever you want to go into the store, take it and then give it back when you're done. And I said, okay, it sounds good. So thank you guys. We have their Waka Yama T-shirt that goes for $95. And then we have a Real McCoy's Loop Wheel sweater that goes for $180, $200 and something dollars. We're looking at something that is made in Japan with the utmost highest degree of care and something that is designed in Japan and then sent somewhere else that can be made cheaper. What is the difference here? What do you see? The T-shirt, it's rough, which is funny to say about cotton. It's not that rough, but you notice it and the knit is very, very tight, which contributes to that a lot. But do I think it will last you a very, very, very, very long time? Yes. Same with the sweater, which is softer. It's medium weight, the T-shirt is heavy weight. It's good quality for $40. It's kind of silky feeling. I think it's coated with something. I'm not positive. Also, it will last you a long time. Obviously though, if you compare Uniclo, I wasn't sure if it was called Uniclo or Uniclo, so I figured I would just sneakily call it both. Here are the differences. This applies to both the Loop Wheel T-shirt and sweater. They're extra bouncy and springy by quite a bit. They're softer, but heavier. The cotton has a lot more character. The rim of the coil sweater has a bound neck with ribbing cut along the bias. Really, what you're feeling is one, the Loop Wheel stuff is knit a lot slower and not under a ton of tension, so the actual knit is flowy and soft and not just holding on for your dear life. And the cotton that they use is also longer stable, so it's stronger. It won't peel as much. It will have a little bit more of a shine to it, which great example coming up. And then finally, a big thing with cotton in general, when you're making a knit garment or denim or whatever it may be, is the way it's finished. What is the process that the woven or knit fabric goes through after it's woven or knit? Is it treated with chemicals? Is it pressed? Is it spit on? Is it licked? You can get real freaky with finishing. So, in summary, with knit cotton stuff, Uniclo does very, very well. I would say better than what most brands are doing at that exact price point. Uniclo clearly has a lot of value right there. Interestingly though, when we look at woven, you'll notice differences pretty much right away. These are Uniclo used giant fit, wide fit chinos. I forget what they're called, but they're the biggest pants I've ever seen. But when you look at the actual fabric, first off, you'll notice that it's a very, very defined twill, the closer and compare it to the black sign chinos, and you'll see a whole world of difference and feel. And that's why I'm wearing these. I love these. These black sign chinos are actually a perfect example of the luster you can get with a longer staple higher quality cotton. They actually have a little bit of shine to them in the sun. Nothing you'd be like, oh my god, it's that guy wearing glitter. It's just such a nicer cotton that you notice it right away and it makes the Uniclo Chino look very dry like cardboard or like a paper bag versus something that's closer to silk. The luster is because you have more light to bounce off of a single fiber when it's all twisted together. You also have more strength. It's also softer and silky smooth. It does feel like bug spray right now, but when I wash it, it will feel different. But denim interestingly enough. Oh, sorry, didn't see you there. This video is sponsored by Manscaped. This is the coolest shaver I've ever seen. It came with my performance package 5.0, which has this weed rack or 2.0, a toiletri bag, the lawnmower 5.0, aka the shaver, and other stuff that's right here that I don't want. My mom to hear me talk about. Anyway, the lawnmower. You're lawnmower. First off, it has wireless charging. Second off, dual tone to LED for pleasing skin tones. See? Wow. Fourth off, cool glove. No, it's a water-resisted, but it also comes with a skin-saped trimmer blade and a foil trimmer as well. How easy is cool glove? The trimmer blade gets the Longies, foil blade gets the Shardies. And on top of all of that, you also get a pair of free undies that I'm going to use to dry my table off. Thank you, Manscaped for sponsoring this video. You can use my code Iron Snail to save 20% off your first order and get free international shipping and a free gift for your jewels. Denim is kind of the end. I'll be all here. I'll be honest with you. I don't like the pants that I'm showing you. I also for some reason I must have been drunk or something. I bought a size 34. I wear like a size 2930, which is odd. I don't know why I did that. That being said, they did just release a non-stretch regular fit selvage denim for like 50 bucks. I guarantee anybody that's not a denim nerd, you give them those jeans. They will say those are the best jeans that they've ever held in their lives. Picture this, it's Christmas time. A young couple is sitting around a tree. A girlfriend gives her boyfriend a pair of Uniclo-Celvedged denim jeans. And he says, wow, thanks babe. You knew I wanted to get into celvedged denim. These are the nicest jeans I've ever seen. Boom! I kick in the door and I'm like the nicest jeans you've ever seen. What about these? These are Mr. Freedom X Sugarcane California Lot number 54, re-additioned with new old stock cone mills unsanforized denim. And then I'm standing there and I say, ho ho ho, and I leave him the jeans and I leave. And they say, wow, I love the denim community. Anytime Uniclo denim comes up, especially their selvage denim, everybody's amazed including me at the quality of it. But in reality, this is part of the reason they're so good at doing cotton products. And that is because cotton as a raw material, very very very cheap because it's literally everywhere. So that gives Uniclo a lot of leeway to make things a little heavier, to make things higher quality because they can still keep the price of the garment low because of what they're using. Then what's the difference between these and Mr. Freedom? Virtually everything. First off, interestingly, all of the threads on Mr. Freedom are cotton and there's 12 different thread thicknesses and types used throughout both for style, function, things like that. This uses new old stock cone mills denim, which is one of the most famous denim mills that ever existed. This is the denim that people around the world study. It's what Levi's used. They had a golden handshake, beautifully aged hardware, copper hardware, nicer pocket bags. The denim is nicer. It's unsanfrized. So it shrinks when you put it in the water for the first time. You get the experience with it. It's an artist in denim. It will last you a long time. But so will Uniclo, but obviously two different beasts entirely. This is Uniclo's rip off of a barber spade jacket, which is what I saw in Uniclo that maybe want to do this video because I was like, how on earth did they make that? It feels nothing like barber. Obviously, it's also not wax. I think it's DWR coated. Not that good a quality and pretty thin, but does have a good look to it. And that's really the end of the good. There is some not bad, but now we're going to get to that spot. Two, is Uniclo fast fashion just like team Winshian? Part of the frustration we have in marketing is that Mr. Uni wanted to say, I'm going to build a company that moves very quickly and is being innovative, said John C.J. Fast Retailing's President of Global Creative. So we called it Fast Retailing, but the press look at that and go, aha! So you are fast fashion, but we are not. So the first step I will tell people is it's not fast fashion because we will never make disposable clothing. By definition, Uniclo is not doing fast fashion at all because what we accept as fast fashion is literally mind-bendingly fast. There is no consideration that goes into the materials. Just base fabrics are dyed to look a certain way and they're incredibly cheap and they're shipped out the door. A big company calls, a manufacturer and says, I need 500,000 of these by next week shipped to me. And all of a sudden everybody's ripping through garments with no care for quality or anything along those lines. That is not what Uniclo is doing. They are designing their own fabrics for specific ways, for specific looks that have intended purposes, their workshop and fits. And what I really find cool is the way Uniclo talks to their manufacturers, which is I think what makes them so special. They have their own little baby manufacturing facilities where they test garments, fabrics, tear strains, are their cold pockets in this jacket, whatever it may be. They make the garments and design them in house. And then they find a manufacturer that has the exact same machines, technologies and whatever that their baby manufacturer has. And they say, hey, do this. Copy us exactly. Here is everything you need to do. Do it that way into our standards. I will say, no, that is not unique to Uniclo at all. A lot of companies do that. And also, you will see a general increase in quality when you're not asking a manufacturer to turn around something in five days. Three, the bad. Maybe we scratch the word bad because of three, the $40 Marino wool sweater, $100 cashmere sweater. Those are insane prices that we will get into that when we get to the ugly. But either way, can you guess which sweater is which? Which one is like $400, $500? Which one is $40? If you guessed the little tiny gray sweater is the fancy one, you would be correct. That is a Max Maris sweater that Taylor thrifted for like five bucks. When we're looking at Uniclo, wool is where we start to see the cracks because it's a more expensive raw material. Both Max Maris and Uniclo use very, very fine yarns, but Uniclo just has them very far apart. It's not a tense knit at all. It's very, very loose. And you probably think I'm going to say also the Max Maris sweater is so much softer than Uniclo. It's so much nicer in that regard. It is actually not. It might be similar, maybe a little coarser, but it definitely feels crisp when Uniclo feels like they're going for a soft and a little silky. And that's because of super washing. I don't want to say I hate super washing because there is some cool stuff about it and you can do it in a better way than other brands do. But super washing is essentially saying, hey, how can we make this natural wool fiber as close to polyester as possible? And essentially what you do when you super wash something is wool has a bunch of little barbs, a bunch of little hooks. That's why if you wash it in a washing machine, it felt, it sticks together and you can feel when you pull apart a felted sweater or something like that. Super washing it removes those. Typically through chlorine gas. There's also chlorine solution that you can use, which is not the gas, which is apparently waste vapor for the workers. And they burn the barbs of the wool off. And then a lot of brands and yarn makers then coat the fiber in a very thin polymer that never comes off. And it does a lot of things that you might like for your wool sweater, but secretly there's a lot of things that kind of suck that it does here, a sweater. What does it do that you'd like? It makes your wool garments machine washable. They're softer. They can be dyed brighter and more vibrant colors. Some say they're a bit more durable, but Michael, I like all those things. They'll sound great for a sweater. What could possibly be bad about it? The knit can lose a lot of its bounce and not return to the same shape. It absorbs water a lot faster. You lose some of the temperature regulating properties of wool. And it's also terrible for the environment. And it's a mix of the polyester properties and wool, which I guess is good and you're using less synthetic materials overall. So that's good. You could plasma treat wool, which does not use chlorine gas. And I don't think coats the wool in plastic. And it just electrifies the wool and removes the barbs. That's very cool. That's new and emerging. So there are a lot of benefits of super washing, but there are things that you lose, which I don't like. I'd rather have it 100% natural. If it's going to felt and I have to hand wash it, so be it. 3.5 Uniclo's quality lies within its construction. Materials are up for debate. Remember before when I tricked you and I said the shirts were the same price and they weren't the same price. They were very different. These are the two shirts. One of them from Uniclo, the other from a brand called 1111. Obviously taken from Santa in the strange mic on point. Great shirt. I love this shirt. That's what I said as I was robbing them blind. This is where my big epiphany with Uniclo was. I found a wool jacket that I really loved at Uniclo and I was like, this is actually incredible. Found the same thing with a sweater. It's like, this is phenomenal. I meant to say a jacket that felt like wool, but was polyester, sweater too. And at that moment, everything that needed to come together came together and I realized, oh, this is what's happening. Uniclo, like I said, has absolutely fantastic quality control. All of the garments that I've ever touched from them have been spot on. The construction is great, but they are at the mercy of the raw goods that they are using to get things as low priced as possible. And when you look at their synthetic line, their synthetic wool jackets, polyester jackets, that is to me top tier. I don't know why I would ever recommend you get a different polyester wool imitation jacket. It's not as good as real wool at all. That's not what I'm saying, but if that's what you're looking for, don't go anywhere else. Uniclo really researches their products and they make sure they're built to a certain level of quality. And that's great. But when you want to start to implement natural materials, which are much more expensive than synthetic materials, all of a sudden, the construction is still there, but the quality of the fabric starts to degrade pretty fast. Uniclo works very hard to make very high quality garments out of the materials that will hit a certain price point. And those materials sometimes have a lot of drawbacks or have to be lower quality to make the garment that is built well from a sewing and design perspective possible. Anyways, the true ugly. It's probably quite obvious, but Uniclo is a giant brand that's always trying to get as much profit as they can to make stuff as cheap as they can. And they've been accused many, many, many times of using forced labor from where they get their raw materials to where their clothing is made. And in 2021, US Customs sees a delivery on their t-shirts suspecting that they're using forced labor. So, you know, it comes up a lot. They're obviously not the only company being accused of things like this, but they are a company being accused of things like that. Although from whatever I read online, Uniclo is a start. There is step up from very, very low tier brands and they're trying to be more transparent. But that is, that's how I think Uniclo works. Thank you very much for watching. I will see you next two weeks, hopefully in the next two weeks with a clothing item that I can't wait to show you. Bye bye.
