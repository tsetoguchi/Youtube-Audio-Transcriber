Title: Ariana Grande - we can't be friends (wait for your love) (official music video)

Transcription:
 I didn't think you'd understand me How could you ever even try? I don't wanna tiptoe, but I don't wanna hide But I don't wanna feed this monstrous fire Just wanna let this story die And I'll be alright We can't die Be friends But I'd like to just pretend You cling to your papers and pens Wait until you like me again Wait for your love My love I'll wait for your love Me and my truth, we sit in silence Baby girl, it's just me and you Cause I don't wanna argue, but I don't wanna fight My tongue, yeah, I think I'd rather die You got me misunderstood, but at least I look this good We can't be friends But I'd like to just pretend I'd like to just pretend You cling to your papers and pens Wait until you like me again Wait for your love My love I'll wait for your love I'll wait for your love My love I'll wait for your love I'll wait for your love Now, don't even think about this I'm so assigned to a�s W seraitふふ贴 I don't like how you paint me Yet I'm still here hanging Know what you mean Something like a daydream But I feel so seen in the night So I know it's only me And maybe that's all I need We can't be friends But I'd like to just pretend You cling to your papers and pens Wait until you're like me again Wait for your love Love I'll wait for your love I'll wait for your love Love I'll wait for your love I'll wait for your love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love I'll wait for your love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love I'll wait for your love Love Love Love Love Undertexter av Nicolai Winther

Transcription:
 I remember you was conflicted Misusing your influence Sometimes I did the same Abusing my power full of resentment Resentment that turned into a deep depression Found myself screaming in the hotel room Lucifer was all around me So I kept running Until I found my safe haven I was trying to convince myself the stripes I got Making myself realize what my foundation was In the room, and I run But while my loved ones was fighting a continuous war back in the city I was entering a new one A war that was based on apartheid And discrimination A few months later Ay yo, my mama, nigga I'ma be the greatest to ever do this shit Oh, my mama don't like Only dead homies Ay, Soundwave, turn this shit up, nigga Turn this shit up Soundwave, turn this shit up, nigga Tell me who the bitch n***a hating on me Jumping on my dick but this dick ain't free Till people buy another classic CD Get a lullaby for everybody ¡Suscríbete al canal! ¡Suscríbete al canal! ¡Suscríbete al canal! ¡Suscríbete al canal! ¡Suscríbete al canal! ¡Suscríbete al canal! ¡Suscríbete al canal! ¡Suscríbete al canal! ¡Suscríbete al canal! ¡Suscríbete al canal!
